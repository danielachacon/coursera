Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available.

To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Asteroids\".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.

This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help. For students that have done their own work, we do not anticipate that the exam will be particularly hard. However, those students who have relied too heavily on outside help in previous classes may have a difficult time.

You'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge you to use multiple skills at once.\n\nFirst, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend your code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. We'll show you some simple examples of how to perform common tasks in the course material, but it will be up to you to explore the module documentation to figure out how to solve specific problems.\n\nNext, we'll show you how to communicate with the world outside of your code! You'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages.\n\nAt the end of this course, you’ll be able to take a description of a problem and use your skills to create a solution -- just like you would on the job.

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\n\nStudents taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course.

Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. \n\nThe goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: \n\n1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.\n4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\nFrom the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. \n\nBy working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Project. \n\nYou are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will be peer-graded.\n\nRead more","contentRating":-1,"contentRatingCount":-1,"syllabus":[["Orientation","2 hours to complete","In this module, you will become familiar with the course, your instructor, your classmates, and our learning environment.",[["6 readings","Total 60 minutes"]],[["1 video","Total 13 minutes"]],[["Welcome to the Data Mining Project!","13 minutes"],["Orientation Overview","10 minutes"],["Syllabus","10 minutes"],["About the Discussion Forums","10 minutes"],["Updating Your Profile","10 minutes"],["MeTA Installation and Overview","10 minutes"],["Data Set and Toolkit Acquisition","10 minutes"]]],["Task 1 - Exploration of a Data Set","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]],["Task 2 - Cuisine Clustering and Map Construction","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]],["Task 3 - Dish Recognition","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]],["Task 4 & 5 - Popular Dishes and Restaurant Recommendation","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]],["Task 6","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]],["Final Report","1 hour to complete",null,[],[],[]]],"partners":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"whatYouWillLearn":[],"skills":["Data Clustering Algorithms","Data Analysis","Natural Language Processing","Data Mining"],"productGlance":[["10 hours (approximately)",""],["Flexible schedule","Learn at your own pace"],["Prepare for a degree","Learn more"]],"instructors":[["Jiawei Han","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","4 Courses","63,258 learners"],["ChengXiang Zhai","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","4 Courses","98,284 learners"],["John C.

We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the “rise over run” formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you’ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.\n\nRead more","contentRating":-1,"contentRatingCount":-1,"syllabus":[["What is calculus?","3 hours to complete","Understanding calculus is central to understanding machine learning!

Following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change of the output with respect to an input. Using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions.

Much like the well-known video game SimCity is used to build and manage an artificial city, we use agent-based models to grow and study artificial societies. Without hurting anyone in the real world, computer simulations allow us explore how to make the world a better place. We play hands-on with several practical computer simulation models and explore how we can combine hypothetical models with real world data.

We scrape data from a social media site (drawing on the skills obtained in the 1st course of this specialization). We then analyze the collected data by visualizing the resulting networks (building on the skills obtained in the 3rd course). We analyze some key aspects of it in depth, using machine learning powered natural language processing (putting to work the insights obtained during the 2nd course). Finally, we use a computer simulation model to explore possible generative mechanism and scrutinize aspects that we did not find in our empirical reality, but that help us to improve this aspect of society (drawing on the skills obtained during the 4th course of this specialization). The result is the first glimpse at a new way of doing social science in a digital age: computational social science. Congratulations!

This first module provides an introduction to the Java language and object-oriented programming. It includes an overview of Java syntax, in particular, how it differs from a language like Python. Topics will include variables and data types, loops and conditionals, printing to the console, scanning for user input, and code documentation. This module also explains the structure and inner-workings of a Java class and teaches you how to define your own custom classes and methods.",[["38 videos","Total 95 minutes"],["9 readings","Total 56 minutes"],["2 quizzes","Total 34 minutes"]],[["What to expect from this Course","1 minute"],["About the Instructor : Brandon Krakowsky ","1 minute"],["How to submit assignments in Codio","6 minutes"],["Module 1 Introduction ","0 minutes"],["Java vs. Python","1 minute"],["Java is compiled","0 minutes"],["Popularity of Java vs. Python","0 minutes"],["Installing & running Java","0 minutes"],["Downloading & installing the Java Development Kit (JDK)","0 minutes"],["Installing & configuring Eclipse","0 minutes"],["Eclipse overview","0 minutes"],["Simple introductory program","0 minutes"],["Some general rules for Java","1 minute"],["Variables & data types","1 minute"],["Declaring variables","0 minutes"],["Strings vs. chars","0 minutes"],["Printing","0 minutes"],["'while' loops","0 minutes"],["'for' loops","0 minutes"],["Getting input","0 minutes"],["Java comments & Javadocs","1 minute"],["Coding Demonstration : Creating my first java project","0 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Creating my first class & using the main method","1 minute"],["Coding Demonstration : Defining variables","1 minute"],["Coding Demonstration : Strings and characters","2 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Math operations","3 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : String operations","1 minute"],["Coding Demonstration : Conditionals and loops","7 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Casting","7 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : User input","6 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Adding Javadocs","1 minute"],["Java is class based","0 minutes"],["Defining a class","0 minutes"],["Defining fields in a class","0 minutes"],["Defining a constructor for a class","0 minutes"],["Defining a method in a class","0 minutes"],["Creating an instance of a class","0 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Banking project","33 minutes"],["Course Layout & Syllabus","10 minutes"],["Tips to succeed in this course","10 minutes"],["Navigating Assignments using Codio","10 minutes"],["Module 1 Resources (DOWNLOAD RELEVANT CODE AND/OR DATA FILES FOR THIS MODULE HERE)","5 minutes"],["Installing & configuring Eclipse overview","7 minutes"],["Math operators","3 minutes"],["Casting","3 minutes"],["'char' operations","3 minutes"],["Importing a Java Program into Eclipse","5 minutes"],["Quiz 01 - Intro to Java & The Java Language","20 minutes"],["Quiz 02 - Classes","14 minutes"]]],["Module 2 : Unit Testing, Arrays, & ArrayLists","6 hours to complete","In this module, you will be taught to test your code to get it working. The best way to do this is to write a set of unit tests that you can run against your program, at any time. In this module, we'll learn how to do unit testing in Java, and why we want to do it. We’ll also learn all about Java Arrays, which are collections of items, and ArrayLists, which are kind of like arrays, but much more flexible. These work just like lists in Python.

Instance variables are just variables defined inside a class, and every instance of a class can have a different value for an instance variable. In this module, we’ll look at defining static variables in our Java classes. Static variables are also defined as variables inside a class, but with the keyword 'static'. Static variables have the same value for every instance of a class. In fact, you don’t even need to create an instance of a class to use a static variable! We’ll also look at static methods. And just like static variables, you don’t need to create an instance of a class to use, or call, a static method. In this module, we’re also going to introduce polymorphism, which refers to overloading and overriding. We’ll focus on overloading, which is having two or more methods in the same class, with the same name.",[["21 videos","Total 95 minutes"],["1 reading","Total 56 minutes"],["2 quizzes","Total 34 minutes"]],[["Module 3 Introduction","1 minute"],["Instance variables vs. static variables","1 minute"],["Creating static variables","0 minutes"],["Referencing static variables","0 minutes"],["Using static variables for hard-coded values","1 minute"],["About static methods","0 minutes"],["Static helper methods","0 minutes"],["About Java’s main method","0 minutes"],["When to use a static method","0 minutes"],["Other use cases for static","1 minute"],["Other rules for static","0 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Customer tracking project","24 minutes"],["Method signatures","0 minutes"],["Polymorphism","0 minutes"],["Overloading","0 minutes"],["Why overload a method?","1 minute"],["DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle of software development","0 minutes"],["Legal vs. illegal variable assignments and method calls","1 minute"],["Java uses the most specific method","0 minutes"],["Multiple constructors","8 minutes"],["Coding Demonstration : Dog project","39 minutes"],["Module 3 Resources (DOWNLOAD RELEVANT CODE AND/OR DATA FILES FOR THIS MODULE HERE)","5 minutes"],["Quiz 05 - Static Variables & Methods","8 minutes"],["Quiz 06 - Polymorphism - Overloading","12 minutes"]]]],"partners":["University of Pennsylvania"],"whatYouWillLearn":["Identify core aspects of object-oriented programming and features of the Java language.","Use Eclipse for writing and running Java code.","Develop programs that use Java collections and apply core object-oriented programming concepts using classes, polymorphism, and method overloading.","Test code by applying principles of test-driven development using Java's unit testing framework."],"skills":["Java Tools","Unit Testing","Java Programming","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)","Java Syntax"],"productGlance":[["Beginner level","Recommended experience"],["19 hours (approximately)",""],["Flexible schedule","Learn at your own pace"],["Prepare for a degree","Learn more"]],"instructors":[["Brandon Krakowsky","University of Pennsylvania",["7 Courses","94,592 learners"]]],"reviewStarPercentage":[["5 stars","65.51%"],["4 stars","22.66%"],["3 stars","2.95%"],["2 stars","2.95%"],["1 star","6.89%"]],"learnerCareerOutcomes":["Build your subject-matter expertise","This course is part of the Introduction to Programming with Python and Java Specialization\nWhen you enroll in this course, you'll also be enrolled in this Specialization.","Learn new concepts from industry experts","Gain a foundational understanding of a subject or tool","Develop job-relevant skills with hands-on projects","Earn a shareable career certificate"],"detailsToKnow":[["Shareable certificate","Add to your LinkedIn profile"],["Quizzes and assessments","0 quizzes, 6 assessments"],["English","Subtitles: Arabic, German, \n+6 more"]],"courseraPlus":false}
